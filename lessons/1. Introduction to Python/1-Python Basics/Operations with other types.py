# Operations with other types
# Variables come in different types in Python. You can see the type of a variable by using type(). For example, to see type of a, execute: type(a).

# Different types behave differently in Python. When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

# Time for you to test this out.

# Add savings and new_savings and assign it to total_savings.
# Use type() to print the resulting type of total_savings.
# Calculate the sum of intro and intro and assign the result to doubleintro.
# Print out doubleintro. Did you expect this?

savings = 100
new_savings = 40

# Calculate total_savings using savings and new_savings
total_savings = savings+new_savings

print(total_savings)

# Print the type of total_savings
print(type(total_savings))
