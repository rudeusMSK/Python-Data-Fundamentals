# Which avocado size is most popular?
# Avocados are increasingly popular and delicious in guacamole and on toast. The Hass Avocado Board keeps track of avocado supply and demand across the USA, including the sales of three different sizes of avocado. In this exercise, you'll use a bar plot to figure out which size is the most popular.

# Bar plots are great for revealing relationships between categorical (size) and numeric (number sold) variables, but you'll often have to manipulate your data first in order to get the numbers you need for plotting.

# pandas has been imported as pd, and avocados is available.

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Print the head of the avocados dataset. What columns are available?
# For each avocado size group, calculate the total number sold, storing as nb_sold_by_size.
# Create a bar plot of the number of avocados sold by size.
# Show the plot.

# Import matplotlib.pyplot with alias plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Look at the first few rows of data
print(avocados.head())

# Get the total number of avocados sold of each size
nb_sold_by_size = avocados.groupby("size")["nb_sold"].sum()

# Create a bar plot of the number of avocados sold by size
nb_sold_by_size.plot(kind="bar")

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# Avocado supply and demand
# Scatter plots are ideal for visualizing relationships between numerical variables. In this exercise, you'll compare the number of avocados sold to average price and see if they're at all related. If they're related, you may be able to use one number to predict the other.

# matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt, pandas has been imported as pd, and avocados is available.

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Create a scatter plot with nb_sold on the x-axis and avg_price on the y-axis. Title it "Number of avocados sold vs. average price".


# Scatter plot of avg_price vs. nb_sold with title
avocados.plot(x="nb_sold", y="avg_price", kind="scatter", title="Number of avocados sold vs. average price")

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# Price of conventional vs. organic avocados
# Creating multiple plots for different subsets of data allows you to compare groups. In this exercise, you'll create multiple histograms to compare the prices of conventional and organic avocados.

# matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt and pandas has been imported as pd.

# Instructions 1/3
# 35 XP
# Subset avocados for the "conventional" type and create a histogram of the avg_price column.
# Create a histogram of avg_price for "organic" type avocados.
# Add a legend to your plot, with the names "conventional" and "organic".
# Show your plot.

# Histogram of conventional avg_price 
avocados[avocados['type'] == 'conventional']['avg_price'].hist()

# Histogram of organic avg_price
avocados[avocados["type"] == "organic"]["avg_price"].hist()

# Add a legend
plt.legend(["conventional","organic"])

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# Finding missing values
# Missing values are everywhere, and you don't want them interfering with your work. Some functions ignore missing data by default, but that's not always the behavior you might want. Some functions can't handle missing values at all, so these values need to be taken care of before you can use them. If you don't know where your missing values are, or if they exist, you could make mistakes in your analysis. In this exercise, you'll determine if there are missing values in the dataset, and if so, how many.

# pandas has been imported as pd and avocados_2016, a subset of avocados that contains only sales from 2016, is available.

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Print a DataFrame that shows whether each value in avocados_2016 is missing or not.
# Print a summary that shows whether any value in each column is missing or not.
# Create a bar plot of the total number of missing values in each column.


# Import matplotlib.pyplot with alias plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check individual values for missing values
print(avocados_2016.isna())

# Check each column for missing values
print(avocados_2016.isna().any())

# Bar plot of missing values by variable
avocados_2016.isna().sum().plot(kind="bar")

# Show plot
plt.show()


# Removing missing values
# Now that you know there are some missing values in your DataFrame, you have a few options to deal with them. One way is to remove them from the dataset completely. In this exercise, you'll remove missing values by removing all rows that contain missing values.

# pandas has been imported as pd and avocados_2016 is available.

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Remove the rows of avocados_2016 that contain missing values and store the remaining rows in avocados_complete.
# Verify that all missing values have been removed from avocados_complete. Calculate each column that has NAs and print.

# Remove rows with missing values
avocados_complete = avocados_2016.dropna()

# Check if any columns contain missing values
print(avocados_complete.isna().any())

# Replacing missing values
# Another way of handling missing values is to replace them all with the same value. For numerical variables, one option is to replace values with 0â€” you'll do this here. However, when you replace missing values, you make assumptions about what a missing value means. In this case, you will assume that a missing number sold means that no sales for that avocado type were made that week.

# In this exercise, you'll see how replacing missing values can affect the distribution of a variable using histograms. You can plot histograms for multiple variables at a time as follows:

# dogs[["height_cm", "weight_kg"]].hist()
# pandas has been imported as pd and matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt. The avocados_2016 dataset is available.

# Instructions 1/2
# 50 XP
# Instructions 1/2
# 50 XP
# A list has been created, cols_with_missing, containing the names of columns with missing values: "small_sold", "large_sold", and "xl_sold".
# Create a histogram of those columns.
# Show the plot.


# List the columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = ["small_sold", "large_sold", "xl_sold"]

# Create histograms showing the distributions cols_with_missing
avocados_2016[cols_with_missing].plot(kind="hist")

# Fill in missing values with 0
avocados_filled = avocados_2016.fillna(0)

# Create histograms of the filled columns
avocados_filled[cols_with_missing].hist()

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# List of dictionaries
# You recently got some new avocado data from 2019 that you'd like to put in a DataFrame using the list of dictionaries method. Remember that with this method, you go through the data row by row.

# date	small_sold	large_sold

]

# Convert list into DataFrame
avocados_2019 = pd.DataFrame(avocados_list)

# Print the new DataFrame
print(avocados_2019)

# Dictionary of lists

# CSV to DataFrame
# You work for an airline, and your manager has asked you to do a competitive analysis and see how often passengers flying on other airlines are involuntarily bumped from their flights. You got a CSV file (airline_bumping.csv) from the Department of Transportation containing data on passengers that were involuntarily denied boarding in 2016 and 2017, but it doesn't have the exact numbers you want. In order to figure this out, you'll need to get the CSV into a pandas DataFrame and do some manipulation!

# pandas is imported for you as pd. "airline_bumping.csv" is in your working directory.

# Instructions 1/4
# 25 XP
# Read the CSV file "airline_bumping.csv" and store it as a DataFrame called airline_bumping.
# Print the first few rows of airline_bumping.

# Read CSV as DataFrame called airline_bumping
airline_bumping = pd.read_csv("airline_bumping.csv")

# Take a look at the DataFrame
print(airline_bumping.head())

# DataFrame to CSV
# You're almost there! To make things easier to read, you'll need to sort the data and export it to CSV so that your colleagues can read it.

# pandas as pd has been imported for you.

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Sort airline_totals by the values of bumps_per_10k from highest to lowest, storing as airline_totals_sorted.
# Print your sorted DataFrame.
# Save the sorted DataFrame as a CSV called "airline_totals_sorted.csv".

# Create airline_totals_sorted
airline_totals_sorted = airline_totals.sort_values("bumps_per_10k", ascending=False)

# Print airline_totals_sorted
